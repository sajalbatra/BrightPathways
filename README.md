# Bright Pathways

## Overview

Welcome to BrightPathways, a project aimed at helping individuals, particularly senior citizens, find vital services related to old age care, animal shelters, dog and baby adoption centers, and blind schools. Our project consists of both a website and a mobile app, each tailored to provide a seamless experience for users. The website is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the mobile app is developed in Kotlin. Firebase serves as the backbone for our backend services. In this documentation, we'll provide an extensive overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Project Goals

1. **Accessibility**: We're dedicated to ensuring that individuals with diverse needs, including the elderly and those with disabilities, can effortlessly access the information and services they require.

2. **Community Engagement**: Our project fosters a sense of community by allowing users to share their experiences, leave reviews, and interact with one another. This not only provides valuable information but also helps build a supportive network.

3. **Support for Charitable Organizations**: We're dedicated to supporting charitable organizations by making it easy for users to donate online and find volunteer opportunities. This contributes to the sustainability of these essential services.

4. **Information and Education**: We provide an extensive resource center filled with educational content, including articles, videos, and guides. This empowers users to make informed decisions about their care or donations.

5. **Multilingual Support**: Recognizing the diversity of our user base, we've implemented multilingual support to cater to non-English speakers, ensuring our services reach a wider audience.
